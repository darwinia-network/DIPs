DIPs - Darwinia Improvement Proposals
</h2>

At present, DIPs is in its early stages.

We have created this repository to collect, organize, and track accepted ideas from the community.

Typically, initial discussions about an idea or improvement take place on [darwinia discussions](https://github.com/orgs/darwinia-network/discussions). Once an idea is accepted, a DIP draft begins here. When a DIP pull request is merged, it indicates that it is being developed and will be launched online in due course.
