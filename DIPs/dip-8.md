# DIP-8

## Abstract

This DIP aims to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of Darwinia Network's governance. Since the Darwinia Network is based on the EVM, and OpenGov was designed for Polkadot, it is not ideally suited for Darwinia Network's specific requirements.

## Rationale

The objectives of this DIP are as follows:

- **Improve User Experience:** Allow users to vote directly using EVM-compatible wallets without the need to interact with Polkadot.js.
- **Enable Staking Tokens for Voting:** Permit the use of general staking tokens for voting. In the current OpenGov system, the Polkadot SDK's account balance lock model does not allow these tokens to be utilized for voting.

## Specification
